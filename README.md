# FoodFinder: 
*Tired of arguing with friends about where to eat? Want a fast, simple solution? Use FoodFinder. Simply input your desired characteristics, zip code, and radius, and get dozens of results in seconds!*

### Inspiration
When we first arrived at CrabHacks 2025, we were excited for the competition, prizes, and, of course, free food! When we saw that one of the food options was Panda Express, we were excited. However, one of our teammates dietary restrictions is halal, so he couldn't have most of the food offered by Panda Express. To solve this, we decided that we would walk somewhere to get lunch together. Unfortunately, we couldn't decide on a good place to eat. This inspired our project - FoodFinder.

People can’t often agree on a place to eat or find places that fit their dietary restrictions. FoodFinder solves this issue by doing all the work for you - finding nearby restaurants that meet whatever preferences and restrictions your group has.

### Target Audience
Our target audience is a broad range of people:
* College students looking for cheap eats
* Friends in the middle of nowhere on a road trip
* A family who just can't agree on dinner
* Colleagues with lots of dietary restrictions

Those in new places, or looking to find  new food spots. People with dietary restrictions or picky friends. The list goes on and on - anyone can use FoodFinder, as its simple, fast, and free!

### Why is FoodFinder Better?
Google, ChatGPT, Tripadvisor, and other alternatives just can't compete. FoodFinder is easier to use, free, has no sign up, and doesn't collect your data. It gives you exactly what you're looking for, and nothing more. No ads, no sponsored content, no trackers. FoodFinder rapidly pairs you with restaurants that match your tastes, all from your browser.

### Marketing Plan
Of course, we would like to create a social media presence and post videos highlighting the benefits of our app in a relatable way. However, we want to do much more than that. 

Our proposal is a win-win-win. We team up with restaurants in walkable, youth/young adult-centric areas (ie. college campuses) to provide small discounts to people who use FoodFinder to find eats.
* Win: Local restaurants get more visitors and customers
* Win: People find great restaurants meeting their preferences easily
* Win: FoodFinder gains more users and word-of-mouth advertising

### Funding
Because all of the food-finding magic happens in your browser or using free sites (Overpass API, Google Maps), FoodFinder currently needs no funding.

However, to improve the functionality of the app, we would like to use a Google API key to find restaurants and add ratings, pricings, and photos of the restaurants to the results. As these APIs are generally pay-as-you-go, our payment would depend on the number of users of the site. We would expect costs of roughly $50 per month for the API.

### Track: Entertainment
This project is part of the entertainment track, as finding food is an integral part of having fun with friends.
